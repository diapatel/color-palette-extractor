Introducing the Color Palette Extractor â€“ a streamlined tool converted into a user-friendly Streamlit app. This application empowers users to effortlessly upload images and discover the three dominant colors within them. Leveraging the power of K-Means clustering, the extractor analyzes each image, distilling its vibrant spectrum into a trio of prevailing hues. Whether you're a designer seeking inspiration, a photographer fine-tuning your compositions, or simply curious about the color palette of your favorite images, this app provides an intuitive and accessible solution.
